    applications are fixed.
  * enable debugging options in menu.lst again.
  * enable console=tty in addition to the serial console for debug entries.
  * the popular media players have tightened their depdendencies on
    libxine1-ffmpeg by now, it is no longer required to explicitly depend on
    it.

    building.

  * add kde-ltag.bm, thanks to devil.
  * fix --login shell invocation.
  * specify /root/.bashrc to initialize the immutable login shells.
  * strip --login from bash invocation, we do want to actually source the
    default rcfile and its environment.
  * livecd manual update to sidux-manual-01.06.2007.05.22-live-cd-2007-02.
  * /etc/hwsetup is just supposed to be a file, not a directory.

    overriden.
  * remove pwrbtn hack for now, it leads to an unclean shutdown on the live
    CD, add it to the installer instead.
  * reinstate --login option to immutable bash shells spawned by our inittab
    hack. We just need to make sure we've exported the correct HOME variable
    for it to source the correct rcfiles.
  * Protect the double dash long option during sed hack of inittab.
  * Add libqt-perl to "heavier" kde builds.
  * Don't exclude files from /etc/udev/rules.d/, sidux' udev config was being

  * lang= is handled by gfxboot now, remove it from menu.lst.
  * saveconfig and mkpersistenthome are obsolete now.
  * fix belgian locales.
  * exclude boot file from MD5 list, -boot-info-table makes genisoimage to
    patch the source file with a 56-byte table with information of the CD-ROM
    layout at offset 8.
  * revert r5013, it has been fixed properly now.
  * move dmraid and lvm2 to utils-raid_lvm.bm.

    it.
  * change menu.lst to reflect the most common uses.
  * remove obsolete FLL_DISTRO_VERSION, FLL_DISTRO_CODENAME from
    distro-defaults, it set by the fll-builder configuration and shouldn't be
    overrideable on the installed system.

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Update copyright year stamp.
  * Change URL to location of original source.
  * Annotate copyright/license of sidux manual and copyright holder of
    distro-defaults in debian/copyright.
  * Prefix all mktemp'd material with fll., and exclude these at mkfs time
    rather than cleaning up in each individual function.
  * Fix inittab hack, leading forward slash to "/bin/bash" was missing for
    ttys 2-6.
  * Install linux kernel early, and make provision for upcoming live-initramfs
    development.
  * Add workaround for umounting binfmt crap, to avoid bailing out when
    chroot's proc cannot be umounted.
  * Exclude /var/lib/initramfs-tools/ state directory from squashfs image.
  * Copy initrd to result staging directory immediately after creation to
    avoid package selection from calling hooks that would uneccessarily bloat
    our live-initramfs.
  * Calculate md5sum manifest of cd contents _after_ squashfs image has been
    created.
  * Add i18n support for k3b and gwenview.
  * Massive refactoring of build infrastructure. Important build creation
    steps are now done in sequence by sourcing a series of scriplets.
  * Build area must be given as first argument.
  * Use /etc/fllbuilder/fll-build.conf to store default definitions for build
    source URI's, package profile etc etc.
  * Allow the opportunity to specify more than one configfile, and have a
    product produced for each one.
  * Reduce functions.d, move functions for specific purposes into their
    respective scriptlet.
  * Strip executable property and shebang line from sourced bash modules.
  * Preserve package and source package lists for each iso.
  * scapartitions has vanished.
  * Begin cleanup for fll-live-initramfs transition. Remove if/else from here,
    and instead use a dummy live-initrd package to provide initramfs hook from
    an external repository.
  * Support for setting x-www-browser in the case epiphany-browser is
    installed (gnome package profile presumably).
  * When kppp is installed, "fix" its ppp noauth settings via
    /etc/ppp/peers/kppp-options as per /usr/share/doc/kppp/README.Debian.
  * Export fll_proxy and http_proxy if set in fll-build.conf.
  * Again add support for external repositories, along with matching gpg
    keyids and components.
  * Purge old DEBOOSTRAP_* variables, see default config for condensed method
    of handling target arch. Hardcode minimal boostrap option.
  * Annotate default config file with useful comments.
  * Decouple FLLMIRROR from scripts, treat it as just another extra repository
    to debian. Eliminate the need for $FLL_DISTRO_NAME-keyrings package,
    explicitly define trusted gpg keyid for fll repo.
  * Support for using debian kernels as alternative.
  * Impove cdebootstrap verbosity.
  * Remove obsolete variable declarations from etc/default/distro. Lower
    casify FLL_MEDIA_NAME default.

  * Define source iso name in source iso making function, not elsewhere.
  * Chown build area according to UID that initiated build.
  * Source iso neglected to include kernel directory.

    of function, don't return a bogus retval.
  * Cleaned up comment about obtaining source code for fll-builder et al. from
    fetch_source_code(), distro-defaults being present in chroot ensures that
    this will happen now that it has been merged into fll-builder source
    package.
  * Add hook (hack) for installation of local dir full of debian binaries into
    chroot. It will remain undocumented for now, as its use should be
    restricted strictly to internal testing and debugging.
  * Create /etc/hostname.
  * Disable splash cmdline param in menu.lst for now, we don't have a splash
    and it costs us at least a couple of sleep's.
  * Really upper casify FLL_DISTRO_NAME_UC.
  * Introduce squashfs exclusion list logic. An exclusion_list file has been
    added containing a list of regexp's to be searched for in the build chroot
    by one single instance of find. The output is redirected to a temp file
    and used by mksquashfs.

    pick those up.
  * Allow exclusion logic to take care of apt and bootstrap cache too.
  * Adapt packaging to recent additions/removals.
  * Remove obsolete packages.conf.orig file.

    non-free etc. etc.).
  * Experimental support for an external repository.
