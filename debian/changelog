fll-builder (1.0.5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * NOT RELEASED YET

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * disable kdeservicemenus-sidux for now, imagemagick is uninstallable due to
    the libjasper-dev-1.701 --> libjasper-dev-1.701 transition.
  * live-initrd-sidux has been replaced by fll-live-initramfs.
  * temporarily enable serial console debugging entry for grub again.
  * hide implicit aufs cheat in menu.lst.
  * add versioning defaults to the default config.
  * update embedded manual version to 0.1-30-04-2007-live-cd-07-02.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * fix typo

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Add powersaved to distro-tools-x module. kpowersaved no longer depends on
    it, plus is also indirectly depends on X related libs.

fll-builder (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * remove stale /pkglist.XXX files and move them to the build chroot.
  * lang= is handled by gfxboot now, remove it from menu.lst.
  * saveconfig and mkpersistenthome are obsolete now.
  * fix belgian locales.
  * exclude boot file from MD5 list, -boot-info-table makes genisoimage to
    patch the source file with a 56-byte table with information of the CD-ROM
    layout at offset 8.
  * revert r5013, it has been fixed properly now.
  * move dmraid and lvm2 to utils-raid_lvm.bm.
  * add console-tools to utils-essential.bm
  * add kde-stripped.bm for debugging purposes.
  * remove xsession-sidux and restartx from dependencies.
  * mkdosswapfile doesn't exist anymore.
  * shuffle lvm2 and fake RAID support around.
  * add mdadm to utils-fakeraid.
  * add aufs option for menu.lst.
  * create netdev group, if it doesn't already exist.
  * don't depend on unionfs-tools, neither uninfs 2.x nor aufs strictly need
    it.
  * change menu.lst to reflect the most common uses.
  * remove obsolete FLL_DISTRO_VERSION, FLL_DISTRO_CODENAME from
    distro-defaults, it set by the fll-builder configuration and shouldn't be
    overrideable on the installed system.

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Update copyright year stamp.
  * Change URL to location of original source.
  * Annotate copyright/license of sidux manual and copyright holder of
    distro-defaults in debian/copyright.
  * Prefix all mktemp'd material with fll., and exclude these at mkfs time
    rather than cleaning up in each individual function.
  * Fix inittab hack, leading forward slash to "/bin/bash" was missing for
    ttys 2-6.
  * Install linux kernel early, and make provision for upcoming live-initramfs
    development.
  * Add workaround for umounting binfmt crap, to avoid bailing out when
    chroot's proc cannot be umounted.
  * Exclude /var/lib/initramfs-tools/ state directory from squashfs image.
  * Copy initrd to result staging directory immediately after creation to
    avoid package selection from calling hooks that would uneccessarily bloat
    our live-initramfs.
  * Calculate md5sum manifest of cd contents _after_ squashfs image has been
    created.
  * Add i18n support for k3b and gwenview.
  * Massive refactoring of build infrastructure. Important build creation
    steps are now done in sequence by sourcing a series of scriplets.
  * Build area must be given as first argument.
  * Use /etc/fllbuilder/fll-build.conf to store default definitions for build
    source URI's, package profile etc etc.
  * Allow the opportunity to specify more than one configfile, and have a
    product produced for each one.
  * Reduce functions.d, move functions for specific purposes into their
    respective scriptlet.
  * Strip executable property and shebang line from sourced bash modules.
  * Preserve package and source package lists for each iso.
  * scapartitions has vanished.
  * Begin cleanup for fll-live-initramfs transition. Remove if/else from here,
    and instead use a dummy live-initrd package to provide initramfs hook from
    an external repository.
  * Support for setting x-www-browser in the case epiphany-browser is
    installed (gnome package profile presumably).
  * When kppp is installed, "fix" its ppp noauth settings via
    /etc/ppp/peers/kppp-options as per /usr/share/doc/kppp/README.Debian.
  * Export fll_proxy and http_proxy if set in fll-build.conf.
  * Again add support for external repositories, along with matching gpg
    keyids and components.
  * Purge old DEBOOSTRAP_* variables, see default config for condensed method
    of handling target arch. Hardcode minimal boostrap option.
  * Annotate default config file with useful comments.
  * Decouple FLLMIRROR from scripts, treat it as just another extra repository
    to debian. Eliminate the need for $FLL_DISTRO_NAME-keyrings package,
    explicitly define trusted gpg keyid for fll repo.
  * Support for using debian kernels as alternative.
  * Impove cdebootstrap verbosity.
  * Remove obsolete variable declarations from etc/default/distro. Lower
    casify FLL_MEDIA_NAME default.

fll-builder (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * add checking for kernel zip file existance and specific error code return
  * manual updated sid-man-snapshot-31b--WIP-XDELTA-1-Pre3-chaos-2007-light
  * manual updated sid-man-snaps-31-wip-PRE4-chaos-2007
  * manual icon added
  * Added croatian language
  * add FLL_CDROM_INDEX and FLL_CDROM_INDEX_ICON for manual

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Hack inittab to allow "immutable" bash login shells on the tty's instead
    of mgetty.
  * Always preserve FLL_BUILD_AREA, create a hive of temp directories on top
    of this given location.
  * Define source iso name in source iso making function, not elsewhere.
  * Chown build area according to UID that initiated build.
  * Source iso neglected to include kernel directory.
  * Clean up install_from_deb_dir(), do extra apt/sources.list cleanup at end
    of function, don't return a bogus retval.
  * Cleaned up comment about obtaining source code for fll-builder et al. from
    fetch_source_code(), distro-defaults being present in chroot ensures that
    this will happen now that it has been merged into fll-builder source
    package.
  * Add hook (hack) for installation of local dir full of debian binaries into
    chroot. It will remain undocumented for now, as its use should be
    restricted strictly to internal testing and debugging.
  * Create /etc/hostname.
  * Disable splash cmdline param in menu.lst for now, we don't have a splash
    and it costs us at least a couple of sleep's.
  * Really upper casify FLL_DISTRO_NAME_UC.
  * Introduce squashfs exclusion list logic. An exclusion_list file has been
    added containing a list of regexp's to be searched for in the build chroot
    by one single instance of find. The output is redirected to a temp file
    and used by mksquashfs.
  * Remove extranneous remove_from_chroot stuff, rely on exclusion logic to
    pick those up.
  * Allow exclusion logic to take care of apt and bootstrap cache too.
  * Adapt packaging to recent additions/removals.
  * Remove obsolete packages.conf.orig file.
  * Lock down FLL_LIVE_USER entry in /etc/shadow.
  * Add live user to `dip' group, kppp won't be user friendly otherwise.
  * Use update-alternatives to set x-www-browser.
  * Allow choice of apt components via alternate config file (main contrib
    non-free etc. etc.).
  * Experimental support for an external repository.

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * print out that we're about to run mksquashfs, md5sum.
  * mksquashfs -info is to verbose, up to the point where it seriously delays
    the ISO creation, omit it until the progress bar is fixed on amd64.
  * lock down root.
  * remove hwsetup's configfiles.
  * remove dependency on configure-keyboard, smbconf-sidux and
    sambastart-sidux, they have been orphaned.
  * only install vimrc.local if vim is installed at all.
  * add experimental and comment out experimental + testing from source.list
    template.
  * add sidux-browser to FLL_PACKAGES_BASE_DISTRO.
  * rework clean-up for /var/log to preserve permissions, exclude
    /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
  * don't activate deb-src on default.
  * make lang= cheatcode easier accessible on the grub line.
  * add /etc/adjtime to the exclude list.
  * enable progress bar for mksquashfs again, squashfs-tools >=
    1:3.2r2-0+c0.sidux.1 is fixed.
  * add cdebootstrap to extra utils.
  * merge changes to distro-defaults.

  [ Niall Walsh ]
  * overhaul packages.conf
