fll-builder (1.0.3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * NOT RELEASED YET

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Hack inittab to allow "immutable" bash login shells on the tty's instead
    of mgetty.
  * Always preserve FLL_BUILD_AREA, create a hive of temp directories on top
    of this given location.
  * Define source iso name in source iso making function, not elsewhere.
  * Chown build area according to UID that initiated build.
  * Source iso neglected to include kernel directory.
  * Clean up install_from_deb_dir(), do extra apt/sources.list cleanup at end
    of function, don't return a bogus retval.
  * Cleaned up comment about obtaining source code for fll-builder et al. from
    fetch_source_code(), distro-defaults being present in chroot ensures that
    this will happen now that it has been merged into fll-builder source
    package.
  * Add hook (hack) for installation of local dir full of debian binaries into
    chroot. It will remain undocumented for now, as its use should be
    restricted strictly to internal testing and debugging.
  * Create /etc/hostname.
  * Disable splash cmdline param in menu.lst for now, we don't have a splash
    and it costs us at least a couple of sleep's.
  * Emulate more closely knoppix inttab, but avoid spawning too many login
    shells (tty 5+6 are disabledi for now).

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * print out that we're about to run mksquashfs, md5sum.
  * mksquashfs -info is to verbose, up to the point where it seriously delays
    the ISO creation, omit it until the progress bar is fixed on amd64.
  * lock down root.
  * remove hwsetup's configfiles.
  * remove dependency on configure-keyboard, smbconf-sidux and
    sambastart-sidux, they have been orphaned.
