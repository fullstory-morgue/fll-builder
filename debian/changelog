fll-builder (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * add checking for kernel zip file existance and specific error code return
  * manual updated sid-man-snapshot-31b--WIP-XDELTA-1-Pre3-chaos-2007-light
  * manual updated sid-man-snaps-31-wip-PRE4-chaos-2007
  * manual icon added
  * Added croatian language
  * add FLL_CDROM_INDEX and FLL_CDROM_INDEX_ICON for manual

  [ Kel Modderman ]
  * Hack inittab to allow "immutable" bash login shells on the tty's instead
    of mgetty.
  * Always preserve FLL_BUILD_AREA, create a hive of temp directories on top
    of this given location.
  * Define source iso name in source iso making function, not elsewhere.
  * Chown build area according to UID that initiated build.
  * Source iso neglected to include kernel directory.
  * Clean up install_from_deb_dir(), do extra apt/sources.list cleanup at end
    of function, don't return a bogus retval.
  * Cleaned up comment about obtaining source code for fll-builder et al. from
    fetch_source_code(), distro-defaults being present in chroot ensures that
    this will happen now that it has been merged into fll-builder source
    package.
  * Add hook (hack) for installation of local dir full of debian binaries into
    chroot. It will remain undocumented for now, as its use should be
    restricted strictly to internal testing and debugging.
  * Create /etc/hostname.
  * Disable splash cmdline param in menu.lst for now, we don't have a splash
    and it costs us at least a couple of sleep's.
  * Really upper casify FLL_DISTRO_NAME_UC.
  * Introduce squashfs exclusion list logic. An exclusion_list file has been
    added containing a list of regexp's to be searched for in the build chroot
    by one single instance of find. The output is redirected to a temp file
    and used by mksquashfs.
  * Remove extranneous remove_from_chroot stuff, rely on exclusion logic to
    pick those up.
  * Allow exclusion logic to take care of apt and bootstrap cache too.
  * Adapt packaging to recent additions/removals.
  * Remove obsolete packages.conf.orig file.
  * Lock down FLL_LIVE_USER entry in /etc/shadow.
  * Add live user to `dip' group, kppp won't be user friendly otherwise.
  * Use update-alternatives to set x-www-browser.
  * Allow choice of apt components via alternate config file (main contrib
    non-free etc. etc.).
  * Experimental support for an external repository.

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * print out that we're about to run mksquashfs, md5sum.
  * mksquashfs -info is to verbose, up to the point where it seriously delays
    the ISO creation, omit it until the progress bar is fixed on amd64.
  * lock down root.
  * remove hwsetup's configfiles.
  * remove dependency on configure-keyboard, smbconf-sidux and
    sambastart-sidux, they have been orphaned.
  * only install vimrc.local if vim is installed at all.
  * add experimental and comment out experimental + testing from source.list
    template.
  * add sidux-browser to FLL_PACKAGES_BASE_DISTRO.
  * rework clean-up for /var/log to preserve permissions, exclude
    /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
  * don't activate deb-src on default.
  * make lang= cheatcode easier accessible on the grub line.
  * add /etc/adjtime to the exclude list.
  * enable progress bar for mksquashfs again, squashfs-tools >=
    1:3.2r2-0+c0.sidux.1 is fixed.
  * add cdebootstrap to extra utils.
  * merge changes to distro-defaults.

  [ Niall Walsh ]
  * overhaul packages.conf
