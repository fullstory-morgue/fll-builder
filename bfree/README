Edit and save the build script to set the BUILDSRC

It is setup to use a localhost apt-cacher of /debian and /sidux,
you may want to setup apt-cacher to match or change to normal sources.

path_map = debian ftp.ie.debian.org/debian ; sidux sidux.com/repo/debian

Run the build script (this will take a while, look in log to see what's happening).

If you want the kernel extract the 2.6.18-5 zip into the deb folder

You will need to add a grub menu to iso/boot/grub.
Dropping in a kanotix 2006-rc4 menu works fine.

You also need copy in the grub binaries (including message) which you should 
find in your chroot after running build.

Now run ./toiso and you will have your build
(or some log along the way should tell you what happened).

Good Luck,

Niall
