Edit and save the build script to set the BUILDSRC

It is setup to use a localhost apt-cacher of /debian and /sidux,
you may want to setup apt-cacher to match or change to normal sources.

path_map = debian ftp.ie.debian.org/debian ; sidux sidux.com/repo

Run the build script (this will take a while, look in log to see what's happening).

If you want the kernel extract the 2.6.18 zip into the deb folder before running build

Now run ./toiso and you will have your build
(or some log along the way should tell you what happened).

Good Luck,

Niall

1) for use with real debian repos, needed a copy of resolv.conf in the chroot (which i did with a quick and dirty cp in build)
2) kernel version is hardcoded in files/install-packages, tested with smp-kernel
3) added a 64bit branch, --arch= key to cdebootstrap
