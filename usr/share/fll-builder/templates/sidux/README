 :: README :: What to do with this PREVIEW and how to do it

So, finally you have booted the first ever preview to the first sidux release.

Here is just a few notes on this preview:

This preview will be followed by x-delta releases on a daily basis, for maybe a week, until we have squashed all those bugs that we couldnt hunt down.
At the end of this we will have a final.
We need users feedback to get it right, so please use this preview live, install it, torture it.

How to get online:

If booting the live-cd will not give you net automatically, please use netcardconfig from konsole or from the sidux-menu to get online.
Network being up, you may want to klick on the konversation icon to get some help from irc at #sidux.com.
Please use unique nicknames instead of the default ones prompted to you, otherwise we have too many web-sidux-xxx online.

How to install to harddisk:

Open k-menu - sidux and go to knx-installer or call knx-installer from a konsole: su-me knx-installer

We use ext3 filesystem as default and we recommend to use it on fresh installs. Reiserfs is not really taken care of anymore, and ext3 will be easily upgradable to ext4, when that gets usable.
The other parts of the installer are self explanatory.

How to install graphics drivers for ATI or NVIDIA cards:

New for installation of graphics drivers: 

 # ie, as root:
  1. get-sidux-binary-gfx
  2. install-binary-gfx -a (to build sid source)
  3. install-binary-gfx -e (to build experimental source)
   -a     Automatic mode
   -b MOD Build only
   -d     Detect Card only
   -e     Use Experimental
   -v     Verbose
  Valid MOD's are nvidia, nvidia-legacy and fglrx

Run it from console as root. It will choose the right driver for your card, build a deb and install it and change xorg.conf accordingly. Just restart X afterwards.

There is no password for the live-cd:

su-me (former sudo) will do; if you want a password, do su-me passwd.
