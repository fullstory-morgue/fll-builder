What to do with this preview and how to do it

So, finally you have booted the first ever preview to the first sidux release.
Here is just a few notes on this preview.
This preview will be followed by x-delta releases on a daily basis, for maybe a week, until we have squashed all those bugs that we couldnt hunt down.
At the end of this we will have a final.
We need users feedback to get it right, so please use this preview live, install it, torture it.

How to get online:

If booting the live-cd will not give you net automaticaly, please use netcardconfig from konsole or from the sidux-menu to get online.
Network being up, you may want to klick on the konversation icon to get some help from irc at #sidux.com.
Please use unique nicknames instead of the default ones prompted to you, otherwise we have too many web-sidux-xxx online.

How to install graphics drivers for ATI or NVIDIA cards:

The new script for installation of graphics drivers is called: install-sidux-binary-gfx
Run it from console as root. It will choose the right driver for your card, build a deb and install it and change xorg.conf accordingly. Just restart X afterwards.
